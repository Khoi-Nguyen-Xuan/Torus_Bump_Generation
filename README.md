# Torus Generation with continuous variation options 

The script is located in `torus_generation.ipynb`, provided in Jupyter Notebook format. I recommended to run this notebook in local IDE, because some required libraries cannot be installed in Google Colab.

The notebook is structured into three main sections:

1. **Utility Functions** – 4 helper functions used throughout the script.  
2. **Interactive Torus Generation** – The interactive torus meshes generation.  
3. **File Export** – A script to export generated torus meshes as `.ply` files.
