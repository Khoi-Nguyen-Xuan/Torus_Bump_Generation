# Torus Generation with continuous variation options 

The primary script is located in `torus_generation.ipynb`, provided in Jupyter Notebook format.  
It is recommended to run this notebook in your local development environment, as some required libraries may not be available or installable in Google Colab.

The notebook is structured into three main sections:

1. **Utility Functions** – 4 helper functions used throughout the script.  
2. **Interactive Torus Generation** – The interactive torus meshes generation.  
3. **File Export** – A script to export generated torus meshes as `.ply` files.
